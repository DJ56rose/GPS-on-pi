# GPS-on-pi
This project explores the use of GPS on Raspberry Pi. The GPS system gathers data which is then sent to a remote desktop. Plots are automatically generated from the data and displayed on a secure website. 
We evaluate the system according to CPU usage/temperature, hardware accuracy, and security of the website.
